This repository contains my complete phase 1 project.

The project is a website that is used to bridge the gap between design professionals namely: architects and interior designers, and potential clients. 

With the increase in demand of design professionals as various people desire to build structures or redesign their interior spaces for various reasons, sometimes it is difficult for potential clients to find ideal professionals that specialize in specific project types or even find it difficult to find professionals that match their preferred design style.

For the reasons above, this website aims to enable design professionals easily get connected to potential clients and clients being able to get their preferred designers better. 

This has been achieved in the following ways:

The professionals can create accounts through pop up forms and update their accounts with relevant information such as their profession, the services they offer and provide images to show their past works.

The users can signup or log in through forms as well and have personal accounts where they can scroll through various professional profiles to find their designer match.

There is a chat feature to further improve communication between various users to enhance conversations.

The website provides search bars at specific areas to allow users to search for or filter out information such as professionals, specific project types and even particular jobs.

There is an educational section whereby users can gain access to educational resources so as to acquire knowledge on specific topics they desire to know more about.

Users can also get in touch at the bottom of the page with the website admin in case of any inquiries.

Lastly, the users can input information into the website dynamically through various popup forms that serve different purposes such as: posting jobs, updating their profile and upload educational content.

The information from the pop up forms are displayed at their respective sections on the website and those who have posted information are able to manipulate the information through editing and deleting if they desire.
